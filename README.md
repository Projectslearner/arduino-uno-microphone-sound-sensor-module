# Sound Detection with Analog Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes an analog sensor to detect sound levels. The sensor's analog output is read by an Arduino board, and the sound intensity is monitored through the Serial Monitor. If the sound level exceeds a predefined threshold, a message indicating sound detection is printed to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **Analog Sound Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block diagram



#### Pin Connections

- **Analog Sound Sensor:**
  - **Signal Pin (Analog Output)**: Connect to Arduino analog pin A0
  - **VCC**: Connect to Arduino 5V
  - **GND**: Connect to Arduino GND

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the analog output of the sound sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino.
   - Ensure proper connections for power (VCC) and ground (GND).

2. **Initialize Serial Communication:**
   - Start serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 bps to enable communication with the Serial Monitor.

3. **Read Sensor Values:**
   - Continuously read the analog value from the sound sensor using the `analogRead()` function.
   - Print the sensor value to the Serial Monitor to monitor sound intensity levels.

4. **Detect Sound Threshold:**
   - Set a threshold value for sound detection (e.g., 500).
   - If the sensor value exceeds this threshold, print a message indicating sound detection to the Serial Monitor.

5. **Adjust Delay:**
   - Add a small delay (e.g., 100 milliseconds) between readings to avoid flooding the Serial Monitor with rapid updates.

#### Applications

- **Sound Monitoring:** Use the setup to monitor sound levels in an environment or detect specific sound events.
- **Alarm Systems:** Integrate the sound sensor into alarm systems to trigger alerts based on sound intensity.
- **Home Automation:** Incorporate sound detection for automation tasks, such as turning on lights or activating devices in response to specific sounds.
